Objective:

The goal of this project was to perform a comprehensive analysis of customer data to identify distinct segments within the customer base. By understanding these segments, businesses can develop targeted marketing campaigns and strategies to better serve their customers.

Approach:

Data Loading and Exploration:

Loaded customer data from a CSV file using Python's Pandas library.
Explored the basic statistics and structure of the data to gain initial insights.
Data Cleaning:

Removed duplicate records and handled any missing values to ensure data integrity.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conducted a detailed analysis of customer demographics, including age, income, and spending score distributions.
Explored relationships between different features to uncover potential patterns.
Customer Segmentation:

Applied K-Means clustering algorithm to categorize customers into distinct segments based on their attributes.
Determined the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.
Cluster Analysis:

Examined the characteristics of each customer segment, such as average income, spending score, and age distribution.
Assigned descriptive labels to each cluster to facilitate interpretation.
Data Visualization:

Created visualizations like scatter plots and bar charts to visually represent the customer segments and their respective characteristics.
Outcome:

The project successfully identified three distinct customer segments, each with unique characteristics. This information can be leveraged to tailor marketing efforts, optimize product offerings, and improve customer satisfaction.
